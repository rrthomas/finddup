.SH DESCRIPTION
.B finddup 
search the working directory and all files below on the same partition for duplicate files.

.B finddup 
can optional hardlink such files to save space.

Files of size 0 will not be reported or hardlinked as this might give problems later.

This is a complete rewrite of the 
.B finddup 
in perl to handle several issues:

  \- Allow spaces and other characters in filenames

  \- be faster

  \- include nodup in same script

  \- Handle files that already have other hardlinks in the same tree

  \- Several improvements

If run as nodup or nodup.pl the script will act as if started with options
\-\-link \-\-oldresult
